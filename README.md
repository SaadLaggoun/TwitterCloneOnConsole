# Twitter CRUD clone, but on console.
I created a console application that simulates the most well-known features of Twitter. Twitter is a social media platform that delivers hundreds of thousands of tweets containing peopleâ€™s thoughts and ideas.

It includes the following features:

1. User login and registration
2. Admin capabilities
4. Tweet creation by users
5. A feed sorted by posting date
6. Private user profiles
7. All of this functionality within a console application!

This was a fun project to break the routine, serving as a proof-of-concept.
